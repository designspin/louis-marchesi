In the oldest quarter of Norwich, where Tombland meets Wensum Street, the Louis Marchesi has returned to its original home.

The new owners of this grade II listed building revived the name in June 2017 and while younger generations may remember the building as Take 5, those with longer memories will recall not only the pub but the man behind the name. Louis Marchesi founded the Round Table Great Britain and Ireland in 1927 and held its meetings in this very building, which was renamed in his honour in 1976; today, the Round Table numbers some 30,000 members worldwide.  

“The building has a history going back hundreds of years, It has one of the city’s oldest crypts still in use, which can be adapted to suit so many kinds of event: parties, wine, rum and gin tastings, acoustic nights, business meetings, choirs, actors , poetry evenings- the list is endless.

“We also have a large function room upstairs, which was once the meeting room for the Round Table. It’s another amazing venue for events on a bigger scale, such as wedding receptions, celebrations, casino nights  and larger business gatherings. 

Given its age and the stories that have inevitably collected within its walls, Lisa and the team have been careful to preserve the character of the Louis Marchesi. “We’ve designed it in the style of an old-fashioned British pub and added a few modern twists. There’s no TV in the bar ,  just a warm, friendly atmosphere in which people can meet up and talk over drinks or a meal.

Behind the bar is a selection of local real ales  various flavours of Lilleys Cider which are rotated weekly , the bar has a range of gins, including three local names (Norfolk Gin , St Giles, and Articifers) and a choice of wines, cocktails, vodkas , rums and whisky – all served up by a friendly, knowledgeable team. In the kitchens, lunch and dinner is prepared the menu options include clam chowder, venison sausages, and roasted monkfish. 

Convivial, sociable, welcoming, with function rooms for events from intimate to grand, the new Louis Marchesi occupies more than a historic location; it also honours the spirit of today’s Round Table that, in its own words, offers, “lifelong friendships, unforgettable experiences and the chance to make a difference to those around you.”
